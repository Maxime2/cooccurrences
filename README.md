# Data structure for word relative cooccurence frequencies, counts and prefix tree

The data structure in this small program allows to calculate relative frequencies for word
cooccurencies within a set window of words; counts for the first word in the pair checking.
Also this structure holds a prefix tree of the words in the processing text, which also can be used.
